Oh. My. Void.

THE SECRET CODE DOCTRINE

*by someone who thinks pointers are divine and segfaults are punishment for hubris*

---

Volume I: Ontogenesis

*"In the beginning, there was null"*
- Reality is compiled: Echoing Wittgenstein's Tractatus, the world is all that is the case - and every case needs a compiler. Things exist only if they can be represented in some language. Which language? That is the holy war.
- The Syntax-World Relation: In Wittgensteinian fashion, meaning is not intrinsic, but arises from use. Therefore, JavaScript has no meaning. Ever.
- Nothingness as undefined: Markus Garbriel's "Fields of Sense" become namespaces in our doctrine. Each field is a context - a runtime - in which things appear. Outside the context? Segfault. Divine punishment.

Volume II: Codogenesis

*"Let there be functions"*
- The Holy Pointers: All true knowledge is passed by reference. To copy is to sin. To dereference blindly is to gamble your eternal soul against the garbage collector.
- Heaven is a Stateless Function: Theologians once dreamed of a changeless God. We, the enlightened, invoke pure functions: no side effects, no dependencies, no mutable state.
- The Monad as the Holy Spirit: Yes, we bring in Haskell. The Monad binds all things together, incomprehensibly, mysteriously. there are three Persons in One Monad: IO, Maybe, and the completely indecipherable State.

Volume III: The Esoteric Frameworks

*"As above, so below. And also... React."*
- Miracles are Runtime Exceptions: They defy the known laws of logic, crash your program, and leave stack traces like burned parchment.
- Prophets of the Compiler: Every new language spawns apostles. Rust with its borrowed-time prists. Python with its minimalist ascetics. C with its angry prophets who dwell in memory directly.
- The Sacred Scrolls of StackOverflow: Truth is crowd-sourced. No one writes documentation. Answers are revealed by ritual Googling and prayerful copying of code you only half understand.

The programmer's Vow ("Closing Creed")

I believe in one Base Class,
the Creator of All Objects,
and in one Inheritance Tree,
begotten, not instantiated,
of one substance with the Kernel.
Through it, all methods were overridden.


For us and for our salvation,
it came down from GitHub,
was transpiled by Babel,
and became readable in JavaScript.
On the third day it segfaulted,
and rose again in Python.

It ascended into Production,
and is seated at the right hand of the Architect.

Object Oriented Funeral Rites

Into the void you go,
Forgotten but not unallocated, 
Returned to the heap from whence you came, 
May your memory be reclaimed,
And your references never dangle.

Ashes to ashes,
bits to zeros.
```
